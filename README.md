<h2>How it works</h2>
Once you're in the Ammu Nation in Los Santos, there'll be a white marker on the door. When you step in, some text will show up in your chat, showing you the commands and prices to buy the guns.

If you have the specified price for the gun you want, just type in the chat the showed command, and then you'll buy the gun.
